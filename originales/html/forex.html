	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div align="left">
	  <p>Forex, or foreign exchange, can be explained as a network of buyers and sellers, who transfer currency between each other at an agreed price. It is the means by which individuals, companies and central banks convert one currency into another – if you have ever travelled abroad, then it is likely you have made a forex transaction.

	  While a lot of foreign exchange is done for practical purposes, the vast majority of currency conversion is undertaken with the aim of earning a profit. The amount of currency converted every day can make price movements of some currencies extremely volatile. It is this volatility that can make forex so attractive to traders: bringing about a greater chance of high profits, while also increasing the risk.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><h4>Banks and Governments</h4></li>
 	   <p>Policies that are implemented by governments and central banks can play a major roll in the FX market. Central banks can play an important part in controlling the country’s money supply to insure financial stability.</p>
	  <li><h4>Banks</h4></li>
	   <p>A large part of FX turnover is from banks. Large banks can literally trade billions of dollars daily. This can take the form of a service to their customers or they themselves speculate on the FX market.</p>
	  <li><h4>Hedge Funds</h4></li>
	   <p>As we know the FX market can be extremely liquid which is why it can be desirable to trade. Hedge Funds have increasingly allocated portions of their portfolios to speculate on the FX market. Another advantage Hedge Funds can utilize is a much higher degree of leverage than would typically be found in the equity markets.</p>
	  <li><h4>Coporate Businesses</h4></li>
	   <p>The FX market mainstay is that of international trade. Many companies have to import or exports goods to different countries all around the world. Payment for these goods and services may be made and received in different currencies. Many billions of dollars are exchanges daily to facilitate trade. The timing of those transactions can dramatically affect a company’s balance sheet.</p>
	  <li><h4>The Man In The Street</h4></li>
	  <p>Although you may not think it, the man in the street also plays a part in toady’s FX world. Every time he goes on holiday overseas he normally need to purchase that country’s currency and again change it back into his own currency once he returns. Unwittingly he is in fact trading currencies.
	    He may also purchase goods and services whilst overseas and his credit card company has to convert those sales back into his base currency in order to charge him.</p>
	  <li><h4>Speculator and Invertors</h4></li>
	  <p>We shall differentiate speculator from investors here with the definition that an investor has a much longer time horizon in which he expects his investment to yield a profit. Regardless of the difference both speculators and investors will approach the FX market to exploit the movement in currency pairs.
	    They both will have their reason for believing a particular currency will perform better or worse as the case may be and will buy or sell accordingly. They may decide that the Euro will appreciate against the US Dollar and take what is called a long position in Euro. If the Euro does in fact gain ground against the US Dollar they will have made a profit.</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How does it Work?</h3>
  	 <p>Unlike shares or commodities, forex trading does not take place on exchanges but directly between two parties, in an over-the-counter (OTC) market. The forex market is run by a global network of banks, spread across four major forex trading centres in different time zones: London, New York, Sydney and Tokyo. Because there is no central location, you can trade forex 24 hours a day.</p>
	<p>There are three different types of forex market</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><h4>Spot forex market</h4></li> The physical exchange of a currency pair, which takes place at the exact point the trade is settled – ie ‘on the spot’ – or within a short period of time
	  <li><h4>Forward forex market</h4></li> <p>A contract is agreed to buy or sell a set amount of a currency at a specified price, to be settled at a set date in the future or within a range of future dates</p>
	  <li><h4>Future forex market</h4></li><p>A contract is agreed to buy or sell a set amount of a given currency at a set price and date in the future. Unlike forwards, a futures contract is legally binding</p>
	 </ul> 
	 
	  
        <h3>Forex Instruments</h3>

	<h4>What is a base and quote currency?</h4>
	
	<p>A base currency is the first currency listed in a forex pair, while the second currency is called the quote currency. Forex trading always involves selling one currency in order to buy another, which is why it is quoted in pairs – the price of a forex pair is how much one unit of the base currency is worth in the quote currency.</p>

	<p>Each currency in the pair is listed as a three-letter code, which tends to be formed of two letters that stand for the region, and one standing for the currency itself. For example, GBP/USD is a currency pair that involves buying the Great British pound and selling the US dollar.</p>

	<p>So in the example below, GBP is the base currency and USD is the quote currency. If GBP/USD is trading at 1.35361, then one pound is worth 1.35361 dollars.</p>

	<p>If the pound rises against the dollar, then a single pound will be worth more dollars and the pair’s price will increase. If it drops, the pair’s price will decrease. So if you think that the base currency in a pair is likely to strengthen against the quote currency, you can buy the pair (going long). If you think it will weaken, you can sell the pair (going short).</p>
